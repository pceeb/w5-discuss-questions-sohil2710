## This questions are due next discussion section (Week6).

1. Describe the Biology of your project? (one paragraph max).  
- The project primarily uses data from eDNA. eDNA stands for Environmental DNA which is all the genetic material that organisms shed into the environment around them. This genetic material provides us insight into the past and present. This is done by first collecting samples, extracting and purifying the DNA and then amplifying the DNA through a technique known as PCR. Samples can be collected from water, soil, sediment etc. This method is more efficient from previous methods because there is no need for observation/trapping which is also a more sensitive method. This method is also advantageous because it does a quantitiative analysis whch aids in population count.

2. Describe the kind of data that you think you will be handling (one paragraph max).  
- We expect to have csv-like files that have a column for specides name, and additional columns for functional traits like speed.

3. What would you like to do with that data? (one paragraph max).  
- We would like to do statistical analysis of the data. For example we would like to cluster species by a given trait and then make a visual representation of the clusters in a graph for example.

4. What will be the output? (one paragraph max).  
- The output would look like a graph/visual that showed the group of species clustered based on the value of the chosen trait.

5. Is there any computational tool, package, etc. you would like to use? What would you do with that? For instance, you could mention shell scripts with `sed` or `awk` and will change the format of a table by replacing `,` with tabs. 
Also, you could mention tools that we haven’t seen in class yet but you herd that may be useful for your project. 
For instance, you could say 
***I will use the package “GenomeGraphs” implement in the R software to visualize genome data***. (a few sentences max).  
- we will use fishbase as our data base. We will use the R package - rfishbase to sort the fishbase data. We will likely use a statistical python package like - scikit learn for data manipulation and visualization.

6. What is your biggest concern regarding your project? (a few sentences max).
- Out biggest concern is we are still confused about if we are going to use Zach's actual eDNA data or not. We are also concerned about what broad biology question we should focus on for this project. We want to know if we can/should focus on a particular trait so we can visualize the use of our program in the future
